Phase 2 is officially DONE and verified! 🥕

Now, let's start **Phase 3: Room 2 (Apartment - Nash Hunt)**.

# Objective
Build the most interactive room yet: a clickable image hunt for 8 hidden Nash photos.

# Room 2 Requirements (SPEC-v2.md):
1. **Atmosphere**: 
   - Warm, cozy, but slightly uncanny (proportions subtly wrong).
   - Jazzy lo-fi ambient audio (loop).
   - Illustrated apartment view (I will generate this background in a moment).

2. **The Hunt**:
   - 8 Nash photos hidden in zones: Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom.
   - Each photo, when clicked, reveals a **letter**: **I - L - A - N - D - O**.
   - **Letter Mechanic**:
     - Photo 1 (Behind couch): I
     - Photo 2 (Inside fridge): L
     - Photo 3 (TV reflection): A
     - Photo 4 (In book on shelf): N
     - Photo 5 (Under table): D
     - Photo 6 (In closet): O
     - Photo 7 (Shower curtain): **DECOY** (No letter, Nash just waves).
     - Photo 8 (Mirror reflection): **THE TWIST**. This one ONLY appears after the first 6 are found. Nash holds a sign that says "?".
   
3. **Misdirections**:
   - 3 fake "Red Herring" dudes that look similar but say "That's not him...".
   - Clicking the red Biggie on the bed says "Not yet.".
   - Calendars/clocks with decoy numbers.

4. **Solving**:
   - Letters spell: **ILANDO**.
   - Input prompt: "The faces show letters. What do they spell?"
   - Advancement: Solving advances to Room 3.

# Technical DO:
- Create `src/rooms/Room2Apartment.jsx` and `src/styles/Room2.module.css`.
- Implement the "Nash Progress" state (track which ones found).
- Use `ClickableArea` components for the hotspots.
- For now, use colored squares for the photos. I will generate real Nash assets for you later.

# Deliverables:
- Playable Room 2.
- Unit tests for the "found 6, show mirror" logic.

Go!
