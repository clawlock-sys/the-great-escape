# Room 2 Integration Task

We have real assets for Room 2 now. Please perform the following updates:

## 1. Background & Layout
- In `src/rooms/Room2Apartment.jsx`, use `url('/assets/room2/apartment-bg.png')` as the background for the `.room2` container.
- Set `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center`.

## 2. Character Assets
Update the `NASH_PHOTOS` and `FAKE_NASHES` arrays to use the following image paths:
- Nash 1: `/assets/room2/nash-1.png`
- Nash 2: `/assets/room2/nash-2.png`
- ...and so on up to Nash 8.
- Fake 1: `/assets/room2/decoy-1.png`
- Fake 2: `/assets/room2/decoy-2.png`
- Fake 3: `/assets/room2/decoy-3.png`

## 3. UI Update (Modal)
- In the `showModal.type === 'nash'` section, replace the `<div className={styles.photoPlaceholder}>` with an `<img>` tag using the `nash.image` (or whatever property you store the path in).
- Do the same for `fake` using the decoy image.
- For `biggie`, use the existing silhouette asset: `/images/biggie/biggie-silhouette.svg`.

## 4. Hotspot Alignment (IMPORTANT)
The background image `apartment-bg.png` is an isometric view. The current percentages in `NASH_PHOTOS` are guesses. 
- Please enable `debugMode` by default for now so we can see where they are.
- Adjust the `position` values to roughly match the visual locations described:
    - Couch: Middle-left
    - Fridge: Top-center/right (kitchen area)
    - TV: Middle-left (near couch)
    - Book: Shelf on the left
    - Table: Center/Bottom-center
    - Closet: Right side
    - Shower: Middle-top (behind the wall partition)
    - Mirror: Bedroom area (right side)

## 5. Puzzle Logic
- Ensure the password `ILANDO` validates correctly (it should be in `solutions.js`).

Go!
