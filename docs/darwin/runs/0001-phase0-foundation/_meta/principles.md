# Operating Principles for 0001-phase0-foundation

## ETTC Mindset
Evolve specs and plans, not code.

## Zero Hallucination
Every claim requires `file:line` anchor.

## Evidence Grounding
Cite actual command output, not summaries.

## Hazard Tracking
Every H-ID must have mitigation.

## Phase 0 Specific
- Follow TECH-SPEC.md code patterns exactly
- No new dependencies (all already installed)
- Greenfield src/ directory - no existing code to modify
